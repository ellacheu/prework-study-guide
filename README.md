# prework-study-guide


## Description

My motivations for this project was to learn the basics of HTML, CSS, Git and Javascript and to familiarize myself with the workflow of a software engineer.
I built this project to use throughout my bootcamp as a resource for all that I have learned.  As well as to practice different programming languages and seeing the results of it on a live browser.
It is a solution of organizing all the material that I will accumulate in this course effectively and efficiently.
I learned the basic fundamentals to get my started on this learning journey and it challenged me to problem solve and debug on my own.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
